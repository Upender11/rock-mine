# ðŸª¨ Rock vs Mine Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to classify sonar signals as either a **Rock** or a **Mine**. It demonstrates how machine learning can help in object detection using sonar data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The dataset contains sonar readings (60 numeric features) that represent sonar signals bounced off different objects. Each sample is labeled as:
- `R` â†’ Rock
- `M` â†’ Mine

The model is trained to learn the patterns in the data and classify new inputs based on these patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is `sonar data.csv`, with:
- **60 input features**: Sonar readings
- **1 output label**: `R` or `M`

> Make sure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as your script or update the path accordingly.
